# Neural Collaborative Filtering Implementation

To gain a solid understanding of recommendation systems, I decided to implement **Neural Collaborative Filtering** based on the paper [*Neural Collaborative Filtering*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05031).

### Implementation Details ==IN PROGRESS==

- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Dataset**: [MovieLens Dataset](link to the dataset)

### Overview

Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) is a deep learning-based approach for recommendation systems, combining the strengths of matrix factorization and neural networks to model user-item interactions. In this implementation, I utilized the MovieLens dataset to train and evaluate the model, following the architecture and methodologies proposed in the original paper.

### Dataset

The [MovieLens Dataset](link to the dataset) is a widely-used benchmark dataset for evaluating recommendation systems. It contains user ratings on various movies, making it suitable for collaborative filtering tasks.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Download the MovieLens dataset from the link provided.
4. Run the training script to train the Neural Collaborative Filtering model.
5. TODO a more convenient way to deal with parameters tuning . . .
